Building the sample parallel codes is fairly easy:

1 - Open a shell
2 - "cd lp3/examples"
3 - "make"

Then you may run:
"basic_test 1" (serial run) 
"basic_test n" (replace n with the number threads you want to launch)
"basic_test"   (launch as many threads as the number of cores of your system)

"indirect_writes 1" (serial run) 
"indirect_writes n" (replace n with the number threads you want to launch)
"indirect_writes"   (launch as many threads as the number of cores of your system)

"tetrahedra_neighbours -in tet.meshb -out surface.meshb -nproc 1" (serial run) 
"tetrahedra_neighbours -in tet.meshb -out surface.meshb -nproc n" (replace n with the number threads you want to launch)
"tetrahedra_neighbours -in tet.meshb -out surface.meshb"          (launch as many threads as the number of cores of your system)
